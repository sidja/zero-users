# This file contains the list of all users who has sudo access and the group of
# servers in which they should have it. In ansible terminology, you need to
# define a dictionary variable: 'user_sudo_access_details'. The keys should be
# username and value should be the list of inventory groups.
# Here's an example:
#
# user_sudo_access_details:
#   rohit01:
#     - team_devops
#   rohit02:
#     - team_ui_ux
#
# In the above example, we used 'team_' as prefix to separate user management
# groups from usual server management ones. All groups defined above should be
# present in inventory file. The users defined here need to be a subset of
# users defined in variable 'user_team_membership'
#
# If you don't want to grant sudo access to any user, declare this as an empty
# dictionary variable like below:
#
# user_sudo_access_details: {}
#

# By default, no user is granted sudo access.
#user_sudo_access_details: {}

user_sudo_access_details:
